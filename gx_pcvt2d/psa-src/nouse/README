                        psa - Point Set Analysis

 A tool for the analysis of two-dimensional point sets with applications in
 graphics.

                                 Overview

  psa is a command line tool that takes two-dimensional point sets as input
and analyzes these point sets with respect to their Fourier amplitude/power
spectrum, radial power, anisotropy, L_{2}-norm star discrepancy, and two
toroidal distance measures. The tool provides the ability to auto-generate
nicely formatted 'paper ready' plots based on a set of carefully chosen for-
matting parameters. For a detailed background on the employed measures, con-
sult our technical report or the upcoming paper:

Any suggestions regarding the concepts or the implementation of psa are very
welcomed. Feel free to contact us via: thomas.schloemer@uni-konstanz.de.

                                Compilation

  psa is written in C++ and should compile by a simple 'make' with any modern
C++ compiler after you set the correct INC and LIB directories in the accom-
panying Makefile. Dependencies are fftw3 (http://www.fftw.org) for an
optional fast Fourier transform and cairo (http://www.cairographics.org) for
plot drawing, PDF and PNG output. Under Linux and Mac OS X both libraries can
be obtained via apt-get, MacPorts, or the like. Under Windows, cairo can be
obtained as part of GTK+ (http://www.gtk.org/) while fftw can be downloaded
as a precompiled library directly from the fftw website. psa also makes use
of OpenMP.

                                   Usage

  psa supports two 'modes'. The first mode takes a single point set file as
an input and analyzes it with respect to the aforementioned characteristics.
In this mode, psa renders the sets' Fourier amplitude spectrum. The second
mode takes a whole directory of point set files as input. In this case, psa
renders the power spectrum of all point sets and computes mean, standard
deviation, minimum and maximum of the non-spectral measurements.
Type
  ./psa -h
for a short list of available parameters.

                                File Formats

  Point set files are currently supported in two flavors: as raw single-
precision floating point data with the extension '.rps' ('raw point set'). Or
as a plain text file with the extension '.txt' using the simple format

 numPoints
 point[0].x point[0].y
 point[1].x point[1].y
 point[2].x point[2].y
 ...

  The functions SaveRPS() and SaveTXT() in fileio.h/.cpp produce such files
and may be copy+pasted into your own project. You may also obtain example
files from http://psa.googlecode.com.
